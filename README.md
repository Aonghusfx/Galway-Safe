# Galway-Safe

The Galway Safe App is an important app which aims to reduce drownings in Galway City. It is important to look out for each other and stay safe around water. 

This FREE app uses GPS technology to track your movements around the River Corrib between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. If you're lingering around the waterside between these hours you will get a notification asking if you're OK, followed by the option to get in contact with friends/families or contact helpful services and organisations like @galwaysamaritans 
@irishhealthservice

This Safe App Saves Lives



NOTE: If your android API is 29 or lower (android 9 or below) you'll have to switch on the "improve location accuracy" settings before installing the app. In order to do that go to Settings -> Security & Location -> Location -> Advanced -> Google Location Accuracy.
